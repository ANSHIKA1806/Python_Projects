# 🏡 Project Property Price

The objective of this project is to be able to identify the cheapest or most expensive properties according to your area and to be able to identify them graphically.

This project is useful for anyone who seeks to evaluate the prices of real estate to buy / rent / build or simply to see the evolution of the place.

A DS will be used, but you can place the one you like from anywhere. A DS of Buenos Aires, Argentina is taken as a basis.
